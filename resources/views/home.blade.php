                        Our main site, <a href="https://tongkatali.org"> tongkatali.org</a>, is named after the famous Southeast Asian testosterone booster tongkat ali, but the scope of our concern is much wider. The agenda is better sex, whatever it takes.
                    <p>
                        Please note that we often self-censor the use of the word "sex", and choose the term "physical relationships" instead. We do so to avoid getting trapped in "artificial intelligence (?)" search filters that are set to moderate or strict. These unintelligent filters look for the word "sex", and then prevent us from surfacing on search engine results pages.
                    <p>
                        For more than two decades, our agenda has been standing on two legs, <b>physical relationships function</b> and <b>physical relationships opportunities</b>. Having physical relationships is like electricity. Think of physical relationships function as volt, and physical relationships opportunities as ampere. For more electric power, you can either increase volt, or you can increase ampere. The result will be equal.
                    <p>
                        It's the same with having physical relationships.  You can have better physical relationships by either upgrading your function, with conventional or traditional stimuli impacting you to a larger degree. Or you can have better physical relationships by upgrading your opportunities, supplying stronger or more frequent stimuli.
                    <p>
                        For a non-controversial example of higher physical relationships voltage, imagine yourself in a cinema watching a movie. Then there is a kissing scene. When you are a teenager, with a newly awakened drive, this scene may agitate you, and if you are a boy or a man, you may react with an erection. You are under high physical relationships voltage.
                    <p>
                        But as you grew older, you became indifferent to such stimuli. If your indifference has progressed all along the way, you may even react indifferently to hardcore visual streams. This is like low physical relationships voltage. Your physical relationships function is no longer optimal.
                    <p>
                        You may still get it going on occasions, if they come by. For example in an encounter with a new, highly attractive physical partner with a conduct that is highly seducive. But if your relationships batteries are run down, the amperage of those opportunities may not do the trick for long.
                    <p>
                        Tongkatali.org covers both, physical relationships function and physical relationships opportunities.
                    <p>
                        Improving physical relationships function is modern shamanism. Proceed to the right nutrition and the right hormone-enhancing <b>herbal stack</b>, based on tongkat ali and including butea superba, mucuna pruriens, krachai dam, and other herbals, and your physical relationships function will improve a great deal.
                    <p>
                        Our approach to improving physical relationships opportunities is tied to market value economics. Proceed to locations where your <b>sexual market value</b> is higher, and know the local rules of physical engagement, and better opportunities will come by.
                    <p>
                        Because working on physical relationships opportunities involves other people, while working on physical relationships function is something you only do to yourself, anything dealing with physical relationships opportunities, naturally, is more controversial.
                    <p>
                        The <b>best strategy</b> is to focus on physical relationships function first, and proceed to physical relationships opportunities after physical relationships function has been optimized.

                        Tongkatali.org is an elite company. For more than 25 years, we have been producing the best world's best hormonal-enhancement herbals. We also help existing customers with better opportunities for physical relationships in Asia, sort-of on a sugar daddy level, though local terminology is different in Asia. The net effect, however, is the same: young attractive women exchange physical gratifications for economic support in relationships that last for some time. And yes: love is a distinct possibility on both sides, without a formal marriage. We help existing customers with setting up physical relationships in Asia as an elite service through personal contacts, and the success and satisfaction rate is 100 percent. We do not run a dating platform populated by scammers. This would be a waste of time.
